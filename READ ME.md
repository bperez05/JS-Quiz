## üìù Notes

It is very intersting to see how to can make all three programs work seemlessly as one to put your final project together. I have learned that I learn more by doing rather than watching lecture and reference videos. Interactive learning is definetly my thing. It's like cooking, you can watch videos all you want on foodnetwork or youtube but you're going to burn a few dishes before you get the meal to your liking. I wasn't really understanding the logic behind Java until I got my hands dirty and did it myself. There are somme things I still don't dont understand but it is all a huge learning process. I really couldn't figire out how to implent a score card to the quiz or how to implement a name database to it. I will be resumbiting this assignment later on with updated java script.
