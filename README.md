# üìñ JavaScript Quiz

* This homework assignment was very challenging as we are now using more advanced CSS and intergrating advamced Java comands to make the webpage function as a live quiz.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager‚Äôs needs:

````
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## üìù Notes

It is very intersting to see how to can make all three programs work seemlessly as one to put your final project together. I have learned that I learn more by doing rather than watching lecture and reference videos. Interactive learning is definetly my thing. It's like cooking, you can watch videos all you want on foodnetwork or youtube but you're going to burn a few dishes before you get the meal to your liking. I wasn't really understanding the logic behind Java until I got my hands dirty and did it myself. There are somme things I still don't dont understand but it is all a huge learning process. I really couldn't figire out how to implent a score card to the quiz or how to implement a name database to it. I will be resumbiting this assignment later on with updated java script.
